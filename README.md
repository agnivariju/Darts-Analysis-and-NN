# Darts-Analysis-and-NN

We are going to use a simple dataset to train a neural network.
The (x,y) location of the throw of the dart gives the label of which player threw the dart.
The neural network will be trained on this data and then accuracy is calculated.

![The dataset visualized as a scatterplot.](https://github.com/prateekmaj21/Darts-Analysis-and-NN/blob/master/scatterplot1.jpg)

Steve (blue) and Kate (red) have mainly aimed at the centre, Michael (green) and Susan (orange) have mainly missed the centre regions.
This has resulted in the formation of clusters.
